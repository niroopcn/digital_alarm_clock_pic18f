# digital_alarm_clock_pic18f

PIC18F4580 on rhydoLABZ Board

Peripherals Used: Timers, I2C RTC, CLCD, Internal EEPROM & Matrix Keypad

Description: Alarms are used in any Embedded systems to communicate critical events in the system. Timers play a critical role in this, which can be understood by implementing applications like personal alarm clocks. The goal of this project is to blow the alarm depending on the configuration set by the user (ex: daily / weekly / particular day). Eight various options are provided to facilitate this. Focus is also making it user-friendly with LCD, I2C RTC, digital keypad and LEDs for user interfaces like menus, display time etc.
